# You need to find a thing, but only have a robot that you send movement commands to 
# (one step in direction N, S, E, W) and it sends back a status indicating what happened 
# (it hit a wall, made a move, found the thing). The robot is controlled by an Intcode program.

# The objective is to find the shortest path to the goal. I wrote a maze solver, but it is
# exceedingly unlikely that the solver will find the shortest path. 

# Instead I think I need to explore the entire maze, then use a routing algorithm to 
# find the shortest path. This script is used to explore the entire maze.
# 
# To figure out if I've explored the entire maze I have to go until all open spaces 
# (including start and goal) do not have undiscovered neighbors.

# I want to save the full maze to a file so I don't have to repeat this process. What format?
# Maybe just pickle the map?

# Once I mapped the full maze I just counted on the screen... 204 steps is the shortest path.
